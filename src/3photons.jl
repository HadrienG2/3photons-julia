# 3 photons: A simple Monte Carlo simulation
#
#
# # Introduction (for the physicist)
#
# This small computational program computes cross-section for the particle
# physics process electron + positron gives three photons (e‚Å∫e‚Åª ‚Üí ùõæùõæùõæ).
#
# It distinguishes a classical Standard Model contribution, of purely Quantum
# ElectroDynamic origin and an hypothetic, beyond the Standard Model, New
# Physics contribution, phenomenologically described by two effective
# operators.
#
# It was designed in the LEP era, so these new interactions occurs between the
# Z‚Å∞ boson and the three photons.
#
# The effective operator can be related to specific models, among which
# magnetic monopoles that run in a four points loop. The two operators exhibit
# different (???)
#
#
# # Introduction (for the numerical guy)
#
# The physicist want to compute a (multidimensional) integral, so we chose a
# Monte Carlo algorithm
#
#
# # Introduction (for the computer guy)
#
# this program started in a purely procedural style:
#
# * read in parameters and initialise counters
# * loop over (random) event,
#     * determining their geometrical and energy configuration,
#     * their phase space weight,
#     * their transition probability for each polarisation/helicity
#       configuration, depending on coupling strength
#     * sum it up
# * then display / store the result.
#
# The use of common (for the original Fortran) or struct (in C) or record
# types (in Ada) or classes (in C++) illustrates an object oriented design.
#
# The fact that we can plug each phase's output as the input of the next phase
# lend to a functionnal approach.

# FIXME: The above is really a program-wide doc, figure out if Julia supports
#        exposing that and if so how it should be expressed.


# FIXME: This manual dependency tracking is incredibly ugly, and I'm very
#        surprised that I apparently need to engage in it. Investigate if Julia
#        truly doesn't provide any better way to organize source code.
